Sean Allens take home project

In this project I covered:




  • Programmatic UI
  • Delegats & Protocols
  • Networking & Error Handling
  • GCD
  • Core Data 
  • Custom UI with Child View Controllers
  • MVC Design Pattern
  • SwiftUI (Partially)


This project is aimed to solidify concepts as well as give an idea of what companies may look for and expect if they 
were to give a take home project for an interview.
